<center> <h2>About us</h2></center>

<p>Would you rather trust a company talking about how awesome it is or a colleague raving about the company's work? 
I'd bet a lot of money you'd prefer the latter -- that colleague is more likely to be unbiased and give you a 
realistic understanding of what the company is like. Including customer 
testimonials on your 'About Us' can give prospects and leads a more down-to-earth view of your company. </p>
